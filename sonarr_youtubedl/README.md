[whatdaybob/sonarr_youtubedl](https://github.com/whatdaybob/sonarr_youtubedl) is a [Sonarr](https://sonarr.tv/) companion script to allow the automatic downloading of web series normally not available for Sonarr to search for. Using [Youtube-DL](https://ytdl-org.github.io/youtube-dl/index.html) it allows you to download your webseries from the list of [supported sites](https://ytdl-org.github.io/youtube-dl/supportedsites.html).

## Project Moved

Due to the popularity of this project I have moved it to its own repository. You can now find it [here](https://github.com/whatdaybob/sonarr_youtubedl).

If I helped in anyway and you would like to help me, consider donating a lovely beverage with the below.
